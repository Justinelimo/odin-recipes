    <h1>How to make Potato Soup</h1>
    <p>This potato soup comes together quickly with basic ingredients. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
    <h2>Cook the Bacon
    </h2>
        <p>Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and crispy. Drain bacon on paper towels and drain most (but not all!) of the bacon grease.

        </p>
        <h2>Cook the Soup
        </h2>
        <p>Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add cubed potatoes and toss with veggies. Return the bacon to the pan and cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender.

            In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy.
            
            Stir cream mixture into potato mixture.</p>
            <h2>Blend and Serve</h2>
            <p>Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then return to the Dutch oven. Season to taste and serve with your favorite toppings, such as crumbled bacon or shredded Cheddar cheese.

            </p>
            <h1>Best Potatoes for Potato Soup</h1>
            <p>Russet potatoes work well for this soup because they are starchy and fall apart easily during cooking, resulting in a smooth texture. Stay away from waxy potatoes as they won't break down as well.

            </p>
            <h1>How to Thicken Potato Soup
            </h1>
            <p>We love this top-rated recipe because it results in a thick, satisfying soup. If you somehow end up with a thinner consistency than you'd like, though, there are a few ways to thicken it. For an easy fix, just add more boiled potatoes and incorporate them into the soup or stir in instant potato flakes. You can also make a slurry with one part water and one part cornstarch. Stir the slurry slowly into the soup until you've reached the desired thickness.

            </p>
            <h1>How to Store Potato Soup
            </h1>
            <p>Let the potato soup cool completely, then transfer to an airtight storage container. Store in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.

            </p>
            <h1>Can You Freeze Potato Soup?
            </h1>
            <p>Unfortunately, potato soup doesn't freeze well. Not only do potatoes become grainy as they thaw, but dairy-based soups tend to separate during the thawing and reheating processes. Avoid freezing potato soup if you can.

                If you must freeze potato soup, ladle it into zip-top freezer bags in serving-sized portions. Squeeze out the excess air, seal, label with the date, lay flat in the freezer, and freeze for up to six months.
                
                </p>
                <h1>Potato Soup Toppings
                </h1>
                <p>Favorite potato soup toppings include shredded Cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, green onions, and chives. It's your potato soup – garnish it with as many or as few toppings as you please.

                </p>
