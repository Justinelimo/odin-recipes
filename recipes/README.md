# Page Layout
- Through my learning, I did come accross a hortcut to make my own snippet for the boiler plate and i did add it on my htmkl.json file.
- I got to learn and understand the various attributes being used in the <img> tags and I utilized most part of it. At first I wasted a ot of time to learn the {alt=""} expecting to see the alternative text/message below the image.

## Tags
- Through my first project, I managed to add links which was a bit confusing especially in nested elements. 
- Through the help of the google and AI, I got to understand better how to call links into a page from another page.
- I utilized most if the tags although others are still abit confusing but I am going to learn as I move.
